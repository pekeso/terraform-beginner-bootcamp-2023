This is the Terraform Beginner Bootcamp by Andrew Brown & Team.

## Week 0

The first week is about setting up the environment for the bootcamp and quite a bunch of introductory topics. 

### SEMANTIC VERSIONING :mage:

Given a version number **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** format.
